expe-1=>Caño Cristales has been one of the most complete adventures of my life. Super fun routes in ON and trips in Off even more. All kinds of terrains: roads in good condition, roads not so good, uncovered laughter, rocky paths, mountains, rivers, jungles, puddles and mud. Sand of all colors and vegetation everywhere. The "rest" in the Macarena is refreshing and the mountain range is amazing. You can only describe the experience as total satisfaction, experience that i´d like to repeat.
expe-2=>Knowing Colombia at the hands of Motoraid Adventure is an unforgettable experience. Knowing La Guajira, not touristy or traditional, was a personal challenge but very rewarding. Excellent organization and programming.
expe-3=>The Vichada goes beyond a simple motorcycle ride and really does justice to the word Adventure. The combination of being completely disconnected from the civilized world, living for 8 days of what I took on my motorcycle, pushing gastronomic exploration to the limit (piraña, armadillo, chigüiro, lapa) and multiplying it by the adrenaline of being on my motorcycle it has no price.
expe-4=>Definitely a must-do experience! The whole tour was way beyond expectations, everything was organized, staff, Alejo and Jorge, they have all the experience and are prepared for any unexpected situation. Customer service was excellent, Motoraid pays attention to every detail and that allows you to really enjoy the ride, the landscape, know your motorcycle and make friends along the way.From the meals, to accommodations, to photos, to adventure riding in remote places where tourists cant reach, everything was great. Going upstream of the Orinoco River and then ride your motorcycle, was a spectacular experience. If you ever visit Colombia and want to have an unforgettable riding experience, Motoraid is the company to go. Absolutely recommended.
the-moto=>THE MOTORAID´S ADVENTURES ARE DESIGNED BASED ON THE SKILLS OF EACH PILOT IN MIND,
important=>It is important to verify the degree of difficulty proposed for each tour. This is classified from 1 to 5, evaluating the type of soil, the duration of the rolling and the possibility that climatic events influence the route in some way. Most of the routes we design have a high component of off-road roads of tertiary roads or trails, proposing a variety of motorcycling.

vichada=>This is the toughest adventure we have yet planned, because of its extent, the demanding grounds and the high tropical temperatures, reason why it is mostly recommended for experienced drivers with advanced knowledge on off-road driving. This is a trip along the Eastern Colombian Plains. During a route of more than 2.500 kilometers we will travel through the jungle and navigate through the Orinoco River (Border with Venezuela). Moreover, we will have a huge variety of sites to spend the nights, from comfortable hotels with air conditioning to nights in hammocks with just a simple rooftop. Hence, it is designed for drivers with an adventurous spirit that are physically well prepared.The Vichada adventure is a huge life experience!!!However, this adventure is only possible in the months of January and February when then climate is dry.
